## **TELEGRAM-READY: Tech-Savvy & ERC-7857 Focused ⭐ RECOMMENDED**

```
Hey DAIAA builders! 👋

Sharing my decentralized AI portfolio with this community — would love your technical feedback.
👉 https://www.aideazz.xyz/card

Been shipping AI agents solo for 7 months using decentralized-first approach: multi-AI orchestration (no single provider lock-in), Web3 integrations, user data sovereignty.

🔥 What's live:
✅ 2 autonomous AI agents (EspaLuz + ALGOM Alpha on ElizaOS)
✅ Web3 infrastructure (Atuona NFT gallery on Polygon)
✅ Capital-efficient (<$15K vs $900K+ centralized competitors)
✅ Real users across 19 countries, crypto payments integrated

⚡ Core tech: Multi-AI orchestration (GPT/Claude/Whisper), React/TS, Python/Node, PostgreSQL, ElizaOS, Thirdweb, IPFS

🎯 Now exploring: **Wrapping AI agents into ERC-7857 dynamic iNFTs**
→ Vision: Users OWN their AI companions (not rent SaaS)
→ AI agents as tradable, evolvable NFTs with dynamic metadata
→ Agent personality/memory evolves on-chain
→ Zero Big Tech gatekeepers

💡 I'm now exploring next steps and would value your thoughts:
👉 Path A: Join a decentralized AI team (AI Engineer, Founding Engineer, Product roles)
👉 Path B: Raise pre-seed ($100–300K) to scale AIdeazz with ERC-7857 focus

🤝 Ways this community might guide me:
⿡ Technical feedback on my decentralized AI architecture
⿢ Warm intros to Web3 AI teams hiring or angels/VCs investing in decentralized AI
⿣ Anyone building with ERC-7857 for AI agents? (looking for technical insights)

✨ Happy to share learnings on:
🔧 Multi-AI orchestration without provider lock-in
⚙️ User data sovereignty patterns
💰 Capital-efficient decentralized AI development
🤖 ElizaOS autonomous agent frameworks

Deep technical due diligence of Web3 + AI projects

Passionate about decentralizing AI and always open to connect with fellow builders 🔥

Available for coffee ☕ in Panama City or quick video chat 💬

## **Option 3: Community-Oriented & Collaborative**

```
Hi DAIAA community! 

Joining to share my work and learn from fellow decentralized AI builders here.

**Quick intro:**
Former Chief Executive in E-gov IT → pivoted to decentralized AI development in Panama

**What I'm building:**
AIdeazz ecosystem — emotionally intelligent, decentralized AI agents that users OWN (not rent from Big Tech)

**Live products:**
• EspaLuz — AI language tutor (WhatsApp, 19 countries, crypto payments)
• ALGOM Alpha — AI crypto educator (ElizaOS-based, autonomous trading)
• Atuona — NFT gallery on Polygon
• Working on: AI agent marketplace (ERC-7857 dynamic iNFTs)

**Why decentralized:**
Believe AI agents should be:
✅ User-owned (not platform-controlled)
✅ Data sovereign (your conversations, your data)
✅ Tradable/transferable (NFT-wrapped agents)
✅ Evolvable (dynamic iNFTs that grow with you)

**Current stage:**
2 live agents, early traction, <$15K invested so far (capital-efficient by design)

**How DAIAA can help:**
1. Feedback on decentralized AI agent architecture
2. Connections to teams/investors in decentralized AI space
3. Potential collaborations with subgroups (especially Conversational Voice Agents, Data Ownership, Agentic Commerce)

**How I can contribute:**
• Share learnings on building decentralized AI agents on a budget
• Multi-AI orchestration patterns
• Web3 + AI integration experiences
• AI-assisted development workflows

## **Option 4: Mission-Aligned & Direct**

```
DAIAA fam 👋

Aligned with this community's mission: "Decentralize everything."

**What I'm building:**
Decentralized AI agents that challenge Big Tech monopolies on AI.

**The problem I'm solving:**
Current AI: Centralized (OpenAI, Google control everything), No ownership (you rent, not own), Data exploitation (your conversations train their models)

**My approach:**
✅ Decentralized: Multi-AI orchestration (no single point of control)
✅ User ownership: Building toward AI agents as NFTs (ERC-7857)
✅ Data sovereignty: Your data, your control
✅ Open: Sharing learnings, building in public

**Live proof:**
• EspaLuz: 19 countries, real users, crypto-integrated
• ALGOM Alpha: Built on ElizaOS (decentralized AI framework)
• Atuona: Web3 NFT platform on Polygon

**Capital efficiency:**
<$15K invested (vs. $900K+ VC-backed centralized competitors)

**Vision:**
Decentralized AI agent marketplace where:
• Users OWN their AI companions (not subscribe to SaaS)
• AI agents evolve and can be traded (dynamic iNFTs)
• No Big Tech gatekeepers

**Current inflection point:**
Ready to scale — exploring:
Path A: Join decentralized AI team building this future
Path B: Raise pre-seed to scale AIdeazz ecosystem

**Why share here:**
DAIAA's ethos = my ethos. Looking for:
• Like-minded builders/collaborators
• Investors who get decentralization
• Community feedback on architecture
