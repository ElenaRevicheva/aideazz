# ?? Upload to Private Repo via GitHub Web (For Browser/Cloud Cursor)

Since you're using Cursor in browser/cloud, here's how to upload everything using only GitHub's website!

---

## ?? Step 1: Prepare GitHub

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/ElenaRevicheva/aideazz-private-docs
2. **Delete the default README** (click on README.md ? trash icon ? commit)

---

## ?? Step 2: Create Folder Structure

GitHub doesn't let you create empty folders, so we'll create folders by creating files inside them.

**For EACH folder below**, follow this process:

### To Create a Folder with a File:

1. Click **"Add file" ? "Create new file"**
2. In the filename box, type: `docs/FOLDER-NAME/FILENAME.md`
   - Example: `docs/01-career-applications/RESUME_FINAL_VERSION.md`
3. Paste the content I'll give you below
4. Click **"Commit new file"**

---

## ?? Folder Structure to Create:

```
docs/
??? 01-career-applications/     (16 files)
??? 02-portfolio/               (8 files)
??? 03-business-pitch/          (7 files)
??? 04-tech-stacks/             (6 files)
??? 05-marketing-communications/ (4 files)
??? 06-deployment/              (2 files)
??? 07-planning-tracking/       (2 files)
??? 08-guides-howtos/           (3 files)
??? 09-website-ui/              (3 files)
??? 10-ai-cofounder-strategy/   (1 file)
```

## ? EASIER METHOD: Bulk Upload

Actually, GitHub has a bulk upload feature! Here's the FASTER way:

### Step 1: Get Files in One Command

I'll create a single folder you can access. Tell me to do this and I'll prepare it!

### Step 2: Use GitHub's Upload Interface

1. Go to: https://github.com/ElenaRevicheva/aideazz-private-docs
2. Click: "Add file" ? "Upload files"
3. GitHub will show you an upload area

## ?? Best Option for You:

Since you're in browser/cloud, I recommend:

**I'll give you the git commands to run in the Cursor terminal!**

This will push directly from the cloud workspace to GitHub.

Ready? Tell me "yes" and I'll give you the exact commands to run!

Or if you prefer, I can:
- Give you files one-by-one to manually create
- Show you another method

**Which do you prefer?**
