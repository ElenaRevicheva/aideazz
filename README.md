## ?? About This Repository

This is the documentation branch of the AIDeazz project. The main codebase lives on the `main` branch, while this `docs` branch is dedicated to organizing all documentation materials.

**Note:** This branch still contains source code files from the main project. These are kept for reference but the primary focus is the documentation in the `/docs/` folder.

## ?? Keeping Documentation Up to Date

When adding new documentation:
1. Determine which thematic folder it belongs to
2. Add the file to the appropriate `/docs/XX-category/` folder
3. Update this README if you add a new category
4. Keep file names descriptive and use UPPERCASE-WITH-DASHES.md format for consistency

## ?? Contact

For questions about this documentation or the AIDeazz project, please refer to the contact information in the portfolio documents.
