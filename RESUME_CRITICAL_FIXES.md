## That's It.

**Don't change anything else.** 

Your resume story is strong. Your BusinessCard website is excellent. Just fix the 6 issues above and you're ready.

**Salary note:** Your $4K/month target is too low. For AI Product Engineer roles with your portfolio:
- Realistic: $6K-$12K/month
- YC/a16z startups: $8K-$15K/month + equity

Don't put salary in resume. Negotiate when you get offers.
