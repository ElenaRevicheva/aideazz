# ?? Quick Setup: Create Your Private Docs Repository

**Time needed:** 5 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy - just follow the steps!

---

## Step 1: Create Private Repository (2 minutes)

### Click this link to create your private repo:
?? **https://github.com/new**

### Fill in the form:
1. **Repository name:** `aideazz-private-docs`
2. **Description:** `Private documentation and strategic materials for AIDeazz`
3. **Visibility:** ?? **SELECT "PRIVATE"** ?? (THIS IS CRITICAL!)
4. **DO NOT check any boxes** (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

---

## Step 2: Run the Migration Script (3 minutes)

After creating the repository, come back here and run:

```bash
cd /workspace
./MIGRATE-TO-PRIVATE-REPO.sh
```

The script will:
- ? Ask for your GitHub username
- ? Copy all docs to the new private repo
- ? Create a proper README
- ? Push everything to your private repository
- ? Keep everything organized

**That's it!** Your sensitive docs will be protected in a private repository.

---

## Step 3: Verify (1 minute)

1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/aideazz-private-docs`
2. Check that:
   - ? Repository is marked as **PRIVATE** (lock icon)
   - ? All `docs/` folders are there (10 folders, 51 files)
   - ? README looks good

## What Happens to Your Public Repo?

**Nothing yet!** 

After you verify the private repo works:
- I'll delete the `docs` and `doc` branches from the public repo
- Your website will continue to work perfectly
- Fleek deployment won't be affected
