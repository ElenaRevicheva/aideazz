5. **Drag and drop:**
   - The entire `docs/` folder

   - `.gitignore` file
6. **Scroll down** and click "Commit changes"

## Method 2: Via Terminal Commands (If you're comfortable with git) ??

### Copy and paste these commands one by one:

```bash
# Navigate to the prepared folder
cd /workspace/PRIVATE-DOCS-TO-UPLOAD

# Make sure we're on main branch
git branch -M main

# Update remote (in case it changed)
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/ElenaRevicheva/aideazz-private-docs.git

# Push to your private repo (will ask for your GitHub username and password/token)
git push -u origin main --force
```

When it asks for credentials:
- **Username:** ElenaRevicheva
- **Password:** Your GitHub Personal Access Token (NOT your regular password)
  - Get token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
