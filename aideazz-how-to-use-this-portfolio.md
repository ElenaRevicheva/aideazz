### 30-Second Pitch
> "I'm a full-stack engineer who built 6 production apps solo using

## 📞 When Someone Asks "Tell Me About Yourself"

**For Job Interviews:**
> "I'm a full-stack engineer specializing in AI-first development. My 
> background is interesting—I was a top IT project manager in Russian 
> E-government, but in 2022 I relocated to Panama and decided to build 
> something new in the AI space.
>
> I taught myself modern development using AI tools, and I've since 
> deployed 6 production applications—including EspaLuz, an emotionally 
> intelligent AI tutor that serves expat families across WhatsApp, 
> Telegram, and web. My tech stack is React/TypeScript, Python, 
> multi-AI integration with Claude and GPT-4, and Web3.
>
> What excites me is that I can ship features 10x faster using AI 
> assistance—I've proven that with real products, real users, and 
> real revenue. I'm looking for opportunities where this AI-native 
> approach can make a real impact."

**For Investor Meetings:**
> "I'm a technical founder building AIdeazz, an emotionally intelligent 
> AI platform. My journey is unconventional—former Russian government IT 
> leader who relocated to Panama and started from scratch as a single mother.
>
> I saw a massive opportunity: 280 million expats worldwide struggle with 
> language barriers and cultural adaptation. So I built EspaLuz, an AI 
> tutor that actually understands emotions—not just translates words.
>
> What's remarkable is I built this entire ecosystem—6 production apps 
> across web, WhatsApp, Telegram, and blockchain—for under $15K using 
> AI-assisted development. That's 98% cheaper than traditional teams.
>
> We have real paying subscribers, we're deployed in a 19-country market, 
> and we're ready to scale. I'm seeking $100K-500K seed funding to expand 
> to more countries, build mobile apps, and grow the team while I continue 
> leading technical development."
