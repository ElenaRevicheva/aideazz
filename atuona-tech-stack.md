## 💻 Technical Stack

### **Frontend Development**
- **React 18** with **Vite** build system (modern, fast, optimized)
- Vanilla **JavaScript** for wallet integration and NFT claiming logic
- **Custom CSS** — hand-crafted underground aesthetic (no frameworks, full creative control)
- Typography: JetBrains Mono, Space Grotesk, Inter fonts
- Responsive design with animated particle effects and gradient systems

### **Blockchain & Web3**
- **Thirdweb SDK v5** — complete smart contract interaction layer
- **Polygon Network** (ERC721 Drop standard)
- **MetaMask Integration** — wallet connection, transaction signing
- Smart contract deployment and management
- IPFS metadata hosting for decentralized NFT storage
- Real blockchain transactions (free claims, users only pay gas)

### **Backend & Automation**
- **Node.js** scripts for NFT lifecycle management
- Automated lazy minting system (`automated-lazy-mint.js`)
- Metadata generation and validation (`generate-metadata.cjs`)
- JSON data extraction and transformation
- **Sharp** library for image optimization
- Bash automation scripts for deployment workflows

### **Development Tools**
- **Vite** — lightning-fast dev server and production builds
- **Git** version control with iterative, problem-solving commits
- **npm** package management
- **dotenv** for secure environment configuration
- ES6+ modern JavaScript (modules, async/await, destructuring)

### **Deployment & Infrastructure**
- **Fleek.xyz** decentralized hosting (Web3-native CDN)
- Production-grade build optimization
- Environment variable management for multi-chain deployment
- Favicons, PWA manifest, mobile optimization

## 🎯 What Makes This Remarkable

### **Solo Execution**
- **Zero development budget** — entirely self-taught and "vibe coded"
- No hired developers, no designers, no marketers
- Vision-driven: conceptualized, built, deployed, and maintained alone

### **Real-World Production**
- Not a tutorial project — **live on mainnet** with real blockchain transactions
- 45 NFTs deployed, real users claiming via MetaMask
- Decentralized hosting, production-grade infrastructure

### **Problem-Solving Journey**
- Git history shows 20+ commits of iterative improvements
- Debugging wallet connections, NFT claiming flows, metadata issues
- Self-guided research: blockchain documentation, React patterns, Web3 APIs

### **Full-Stack Ownership**
- Smart contract deployment → Frontend UI → Automation scripts → Hosting
- End-to-end: from concept to deployed product
- Blockchain, frontend, backend, design, DevOps — all roles

## 🎭 The Vibe Coding Philosophy

> *"I had a vision. No money for devs or marketers. So I built it myself, one search query and one bug fix at a time. Still upgrading via vibe coding."*

This project proves:
- **Vision beats budget** — resourcefulness > resources
- **Iterative beats perfect** — ship, learn, improve
- **Solo beats stalled** — better to build alone than wait for a team

---

## 📂 Repository Highlights

- `src/ClaimPoem.jsx` — React component with Thirdweb wallet + NFT claiming
- `automated-lazy-mint.js` — Node.js script for batch NFT minting
- `index.html` — 3,984 lines of hand-crafted HTML/CSS/JS
- `metadata/` — 45 JSON files with poem data, images, attributes
- `complete-setup.sh` — Bash automation for deployment workflow

---

## 🚀 What's Next

Currently upgrading via vibe coding:
- Enhanced UI/UX based on user feedback
- Additional smart contract features
- Marketing site improvements
- SEO and accessibility optimizations

**The takeaway:** I learn fast, build real things, and ship to production — regardless of budget constraints.
