# Resume: Critical Fixes Only

## 🚨 Fix These 3 Things IMMEDIATELY

### 1. **Fix AI Model Names (Update to Current Versions)**

**Your resume says:**
```
GPT-5 · Claude Opus 4 · Model Context Protocol (MCP)
```

**The problem:**
- GPT-5 is NOT released yet (rumored but not public)
- "Claude Opus 4" doesn't exist 
- Current models are: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus

**What you're ACTUALLY using:**
- In Cursor: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- In your projects: GPT-4o or GPT-4 Turbo

**Change to (accurate):**
```
GPT-4/GPT-4o · Claude 3.5 Sonnet · Model Context Protocol (MCP)
```

**Or (more generic but safe):**
```
OpenAI GPT-4 · Anthropic Claude · Model Context Protocol (MCP)
```

### 2. **Fix Overlapping Employment Dates**

#### Fundery overlaps with E-Gov (2017-2018):
```
Deputy CEO – Business Development — Fundery LLC (Fintech/Blockchain)
📍 Russia | 📅 Aug 2017 – Apr 2018

Change to:
📍 Russia | 📅 Aug 2017 – Apr 2018 (concurrent/consulting)
```

#### OmniBazaar overlaps with AIdeazz:
```
Operational Co-Founder — OmniBazaar Start up (Decentralized Marketplace)
📍 Remote | 📅 Oct 2024 – June 2025

Change to:
📍 Remote | 📅 Oct 2024 – June 2025 (part-time advisor)
```

### 3. **Add Actual URLs in Contact Header**

**Current:**
```
🔗 Portfolio | GitHub | LinkedIn | Website
```

**Change to:**
```
🔗 aideazz.xyz/card | github.com/ElenaRevicheva | linkedin.com/in/elenarevicheva | aideazz.xyz
```

## ⚠️ Fix These 3 Things for Stronger Impact

### 4. **Replace "Lines of Code" with Outcome**

**Current:**
```
✅ 50,000+ lines of code (TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, SQL) solo-developed
```

**Why this is weak:**
Lines of code is NOT a success metric in modern development. Nobody cares how many lines you wrote.

**Change to:**
```
✅ Full-stack solo development across 6 production applications (TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, SQL)
```

---

### 5. **Add Specific Numbers to Traction (if you have them)**

**Current:**
```
Traction & Monetization:
Growing organically with early user adoption across Panama and LATAM
```

**Change to one of these (if you have numbers):**
```
[X] active users across Panama and LATAM
Daily conversations with users across 5+ countries in LATAM
Early adoption with [Y] messages processed monthly
```

**If you don't have numbers:**
```
Early user adoption with daily active conversations across Panama and LATAM
```

---

### 6. **Clarify ISD Relationship**

**Current:**
```
🎯 Supported by Innovation Smart District (ISD), Panama
```

**Problem:** "Supported by" sounds like they're funding you

**Change to:**
```
🎯 Member of Innovation Smart District (ISD), Panama
```

**Or:**
```
🎯 Part of Innovation Smart District (ISD) community, Panama
```

## That's It.

**Don't change anything else.** 

Your resume story is strong. Your BusinessCard website is excellent. Just fix the 6 issues above and you're ready.

## 💰 Critical Reality Check: Salary

**Your stated target:** "not less than 4000 USD monthly"

**Market reality for AI Product Engineer with your portfolio:**
- Remote AI roles: **$6,000-$12,000/month**
- YC/a16z early engineer: **$8,000-$15,000/month + equity**
- Your 6 live products + full-stack + Web3 = **premium positioning**

**Recommendation:** 
- **Don't put salary in resume** - negotiate based on offer
- Know your minimum is **$6K, not $4K**
- Aim for **$8K-$10K + equity** for startup roles

## 📝 Summary: What to Change

1. ✅ AI models: GPT-5 → GPT-4/GPT-4o, Claude Opus 4 → Claude 3.5 Sonnet
2. ✅ Overlapping dates: Add "(part-time)" or "(concurrent)" labels
3. ✅ Contact URLs: Add actual clickable/copyable links
4. ✅ Lines of code: Replace with outcome-based metric
5. ✅ Traction: Add specific numbers if possible
6. ✅ ISD: Change "Supported by" to "Member of"
