## ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE STILL REMAINING:

### Contact Information - NO ACTUAL LINKS!

**Current:**
```
📧 E-mail 
📱 WhatsApp | Telegram  
🔗 Portfolio | GitHub | LinkedIn | Website 
```

**Problem:** These are just labels, not actual contact info!

**Change to:**
```
📧 elena.revicheva2016@gmail.com | aipa@aideazz.xyz
📱 +507 61666716 (WhatsApp, Telegram)
🔗 aideazz.xyz/card | github.com/ElenaRevicheva | linkedin.com/in/elenarevicheva | aideazz.xyz
```

**Why this matters:** 
- Recruiters can't contact you if they can't see your email
- Investors need to click/copy your links
- Currently they have to guess or search for you

---

## ⚠️ Minor Improvements (Optional but Helpful):

### 1. Traction Numbers Still Vague
**Current:** "early user adoption across Panama and other 19 Spanish-speaking countries"

**Better (if you have numbers):**
- "X active users across Panama and 19 Spanish-speaking countries"
- "Daily conversations with users across Panama and LATAM"

**If you don't have numbers:** Current is fine.

---

### 2. Small Formatting Inconsistencies

**"Languages" section appears twice:**
- Under Tech DNA: "Languages: Python · TypeScript..."
- At bottom: "🌍 Languages: 🇷🇺 Russian..."

**Suggestion:** Rename Tech DNA section to:
```
Programming Languages: Python · TypeScript · JavaScript · Node.js · SQL etc.
```
