# üìß Response Templates: When ISD Member Says "Site Is Down"

---

## **Option 1: Technical but Accessible (RECOMMENDED)**

```
Hey [Name], thanks for trying to check it out!

You caught it during a deployment window ‚Äî I just pushed an update to GitHub about an hour ago, which triggered an automatic redeployment.

Quick context: I'm using Fleek.xyz (decentralized hosting on IPFS) which aligns with my Web3 products, but it has a known tradeoff ‚Äî deployments take 1-4 hours because:

1. New content creates a new IPFS hash
2. That hash needs to propagate across global IPFS nodes
3. DNS needs to update to point to the new hash
4. CDN caches need to invalidate and refresh

It's the nature of decentralized infrastructure vs. traditional hosting (which would be instant).

Should be fully accessible in another hour or so. If you want to check it out sooner, try:
‚Ä¢ Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
‚Ä¢ Different browser or incognito mode
‚Ä¢ Different network (mobile data vs. wifi)

Or I can send you the direct IPFS link if you'd like to see it now.

Appreciate your interest! Happy to discuss the tech stack tradeoffs over coffee if you're curious üôÇ

## **Option 2: Brief & Professional**

```
Thanks for checking, [Name]! 

The site is mid-deployment right now (I pushed an update ~1 hour ago). Using Fleek/IPFS for decentralized hosting means deployments take 1-4 hours for global propagation.

Should be back up within the hour. I'll ping you when it's fully live!

## **Option 3: Transparent + Solution-Oriented**

```
Hey [Name], good catch ‚Äî it's in a deployment window right now.

I'm using decentralized hosting (Fleek/IPFS) which is great for censorship-resistance and aligns with my Web3 stack, but the tradeoff is slower deployments (1-4 hours vs. instant with traditional hosting).

I'm aware this isn't ideal for the rapid iteration phase I'm in. Considering switching to Vercel for primary hosting while keeping Fleek as a decentralized backup.

For now: should be accessible in ~1 hour. I'll share the link again once deployment completes.

Would love your thoughts on this tradeoff if you have experience with decentralized infrastructure!
```

## **Option 4: Casual & Honest**

```
Ah yeah, you hit it during a deployment üòÖ

I'm using Fleek (IPFS-based hosting) which takes forever to propagate changes globally ‚Äî usually 1-4 hours. 

It's honestly a pain during active development, but I liked the Web3 alignment. Might switch to faster hosting soon.

Give it another hour and try again? Or I can just send you a Loom walkthrough if you want to see it now!
```

---

## **Option 5: Educational (If They're Technical)**

```
Good timing ‚Äî you caught it mid-deployment! üôÇ

Technical context: I'm using Fleek.xyz which deploys to IPFS (decentralized storage). Each update creates a new content hash (CID) that needs to:
1. Propagate across IPFS nodes globally (~20-60 min)
2. Update DNS records (~30-120 min for global propagation)
3. Invalidate CDN caches (BunnyCDN in my case, ~15-60 min)

Total: 1-4 hours depending on network conditions.

It's a known tradeoff with decentralized infrastructure ‚Äî I get censorship-resistance and permanence, but lose deployment speed.

Should be fully live in another hour. I'll drop the link again when DNS has fully propagated!

If you're interested in the decentralized hosting tradeoffs, I'd love to chat about it sometime.

## **Option 6: With Workaround**

```
Hey [Name]!

Site's mid-deployment right now (takes 1-4 hours on Fleek/IPFS infrastructure).

If you want to see it immediately, here are two options:

**Option A:** Try in ~1 hour when deployment completes
**Option B:** I can send you a direct IPFS gateway link that bypasses DNS
**Option C:** Here's a 2-min Loom demo if you want to see it right now: [link]

Let me know what works best!

(Also taking notes that slow deployments are a pain point ‚Äî might switch to faster hosting for active dev phase)
```

## **‚ùå WHAT NOT TO SAY (Avoiding Lies/Excuses):**

**DON'T say:**
- ‚ùå "Site is down for maintenance" (vague, sounds like an excuse)
- ‚ùå "High traffic crashed the server" (not true, and IPFS doesn't work that way)
- ‚ùå "It's working fine for me" (dismissive, doesn't help them)
- ‚ùå "Try again later" (without explaining why)
- ‚ùå "Must be your internet" (deflecting blame)
- ‚ùå Nothing (ignoring the comment)

**DO say:**
- ‚úÖ Honest reason: deployment in progress
- ‚úÖ Expected timeline: 1-4 hours
- ‚úÖ Technical context: IPFS/decentralized hosting tradeoffs
- ‚úÖ Workaround: hard refresh, different network, or wait
- ‚úÖ Acknowledgment: "Not ideal for rapid iteration, considering alternatives"
- ‚úÖ Follow-up: "Will ping when it's live" or offer alternative (Loom demo)

---

## **FOLLOW-UP (When Site Is Back Up):**

```
@[Name] ‚Äî site's fully deployed now! Should be accessible at www.aideazz.xyz/card

Let me know if you have any feedback üôÇ
```

---

## **PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION (Before Deployment):**

If you know you're about to deploy:

```
Heads up ISD community: Pushing an update to aideazz.xyz in the next hour.

Site will be unreachable for ~2-3 hours during deployment (decentralized hosting propagation time).

I'll drop a note when it's back up!
```

This sets expectations and shows you're aware + considerate of the limitation.

---

## **KEY PRINCIPLES:**

1. ‚úÖ **Be honest** about the technical reason
2. ‚úÖ **Be transparent** about the tradeoffs
3. ‚úÖ **Be helpful** with workarounds or alternatives
4. ‚úÖ **Be accountable** (acknowledge the inconvenience)
5. ‚úÖ **Be solution-oriented** (mention you're considering faster options)
6. ‚úÖ **Be timely** (respond quickly, follow up when fixed)

---

## **RECOMMENDED APPROACH:**

**Use Option 1 or Option 3** depending on:
- **Option 1:** If you want to explain technically but stay friendly
- **Option 3:** If you want to show you're thinking about solutions

Both are honest, helpful, and position you as technically savvy + considerate.
