## üéØ SUMMARY OF CORRECTIONS

### **What We're Removing:**
- ‚ùå All "revenue" claims (we're pre-revenue)
- ‚ùå All "paying subscribers" claims (no one paying yet)
- ‚ùå Gumroad references (account suspended)
- ‚ùå "3 payment providers" (only 2: PayPal live + crypto ready)

### **What We're Adding:**
- ‚úÖ "Pre-revenue" stage clarification
- ‚úÖ "PayPal Subscriptions LIVE in production" (not just integrated)
- ‚úÖ "~7 WhatsApp users" (honest user count)
- ‚úÖ "180 X followers" (ALGOM Alpha traction)
- ‚úÖ "Early user traction" language
- ‚úÖ "Monetization-ready" positioning
- ‚úÖ "Payment infrastructure deployed" framing

### **Why This is Better:**
- ‚úÖ 100% honest (no false claims)
- ‚úÖ Still impressive (execution speed, capital efficiency)
- ‚úÖ Investable (pre-revenue seed is normal)
- ‚úÖ Employable (technical skills proven)
- ‚úÖ Trustworthy (transparent about stage)

## üìù COMMIT MESSAGE (When Done)

```
Fix: Correct revenue claims across all portfolio documents

Reality check after founder clarification:
- Changed "revenue-generating" to "pre-revenue, monetization-ready"
- Changed "paying subscribers" to "early user traction"
- Removed Gumroad (account suspended)
- Clarified PayPal is LIVE in production (not just integrated)
- Added honest user counts (~7 WhatsApp, 180 X followers)
- Updated "3 payment providers" to "2 payment providers"

Reason: Must be 100% honest for credibility with employers & investors.
Stage: Pre-revenue by choice (built product first, now need user acquisition).
