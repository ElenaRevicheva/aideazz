# AI Models Reality Check for Resume

## What Actually Exists (as of Oct 2025)

### ✅ Claude Models (Anthropic):
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** ← This is what you're using in Cursor (latest, most capable)
- **Claude 3 Opus** ← Previous flagship model
- **Claude 3 Sonnet**
- **Claude 3 Haiku**

### ❌ What DOESN'T exist:
- "Claude Opus 4" - NOT released
- "Claude 4" - NOT announced
- "Sonnet 4.5" - NOT official name

### ✅ GPT Models (OpenAI):
- **GPT-4 Turbo**
- **GPT-4o** (GPT-4 optimized)
- **GPT-4o mini**

### ❌ What DOESN'T exist:
- "GPT-5" - NOT released (rumored but not public)

## Why This Matters for Your Resume

**The Issue:**
- Technical recruiters and AI engineers WILL notice if you list non-existent models
- It damages credibility - looks like you're either:
  - Making things up
  - Don't actually work with these tools
  - Copied from somewhere without verification

**What You're Actually Using:**
In Cursor, you're using:
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (that's me!)
- **GPT-4o** or **GPT-4 Turbo**
