Why I left my executive job to start over at [age]

In 2022, I was Chief Executive in E-government IT.
Good salary. Stable career. 7 years invested.

But something was missing.

I relocated to Panama and made a bold choice:
Start from zero in AI development.

People thought I was crazy.

7 months later:
✅ 2 live AI products
✅ Real users across 19 countries
✅ 98% cost reduction vs traditional development

The lesson?

Your past experience doesn't disappear.
It makes your new skills MORE valuable.

Executive background + Technical skills = Rare combination

Now building AIdeazz - emotionally intelligent AI companions.

Looking for: AI roles OR investment

What bold career change are you considering? 👇

**Wednesday - Thread/Tutorial:**
```
How to build an AI agent in 2025 (without a team or $$$) 🧵

I built 2 live AI agents in 7 months solo.

Here's my exact process:

1/ Choose a real problem you've experienced
(I needed to learn Spanish → built EspaLuz)

2/ Start with the simplest version
(WhatsApp bot > fancy web app)

3/ Use AI tools to accelerate
• Claude for code review
• Cursor for IDE
• GPT for architecture

4/ Deploy early, iterate fast
(Railway made this FREE/cheap)

5/ Talk to users DAILY

[Continue thread with 5-10 more tweets]

Want the full stack? Reply and I'll share.
```

**Thursday - Engage/Ask:**
```
Question for AI founders:

What's your biggest challenge right now?

For me it's:
→ User acquisition (no marketing budget)
→ Monetization (too early?)
→ Deciding: raise $ OR bootstrap longer?

What's yours? Let's help each other 👇
```

**Friday - Personal Story:**
```
7 years as Chief Executive.

One day I realized:

I was managing OTHER people building cool things.

But I wanted to BUILD cool things myself.

So I quit. Relocated to Panama. Started from zero.

People said I was too old to learn coding.

7 months later: 6 production apps.

Age is just a number.
Titles don't define you.
Skills can be learned.

What's stopping YOU from making a change?
```

**Saturday - Weekend Wins:**
```
Small wins this week:

✅ EspaLuz: 3 new paying subscribers
✅ ALGOM: Broke 200 followers
✅ Fixed nasty PostgreSQL bug
✅ Got interview request from [Company]

Not huge. But progress.

What are YOUR wins? Share below 🎉
```

**Sunday - Reflection/Vision:**
```
Sunday thoughts 🧠

Building AIdeazz - emotionally intelligent AI companions.

Vision: Everyone has their own AI that grows WITH them.

Not replacing humans.
Helping humans become their best selves.

Still early. Still learning.

But I believe this future is coming.

And I'm building it.

What future are YOU building?

Title: From Chief Executive to Solo AI Builder - My 7-Month Journey

Hey everyone! 👋

Wanted to share my journey as I've been lurking here for a while and learned so much from this community.

Background:
• 7 years Chief Executive in IT Project Management (E-government sector)
• Relocated to Panama in 2022
• Decided to start from scratch in AI development

What I built (solo, 7 months, <$15K):
1. EspaLuz - AI Spanish tutor (WhatsApp)
   → Multi-AI orchestration (GPT, Claude, Whisper, TTS, OCR)
   → Users across 19 Spanish-speaking countries
   → PayPal subscriptions live

2. ALGOM Alpha - AI crypto mentor
   → Built with ElizaOS
   → Paper trading live on Railway
   → 180+ followers, auto-posting to X

3. + 4 other projects (NFT gallery, Web3 tools, etc.)

Tech Stack:
• Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite
• Backend: Python/Flask, Node.js, PostgreSQL
• AI: GPT-4, Claude, ElizaOS, LangChain
• Deployment: Railway, Docker, Supabase

Lessons learned:
1. AI tools (Cursor, Claude) made me 10x faster
2. Ship early, iterate based on user feedback
3. Capital efficiency matters - <$15K vs typical $900K+
4. Executive background + technical skills = valuable combo

Next steps:
• Seeking: AI Product/Engineering roles OR pre-seed investment
• Building v2 of both products (more intelligent, more personalized)

Happy to answer any questions or chat!

What are you all building? 🚀

## 🎯 FINAL THOUGHTS & MOTIVATION

### **Remember:**

You have a UNIQUE story:
- Not a 22-year-old fresh grad
- Not a typical founder
- You're an executive who chose to start from scratch
- You PROVED you can execute (6 apps in 7 months)
- You're capital efficient (<$15K!)
- You're bilingual (2x the market)

### **Your Advantages:**

✅ **Experience:** 7 years executive = you understand business  
✅ **Execution:** 6 apps = you can ship  
✅ **Timing:** AI hiring boom = perfect moment  
✅ **Location:** Panama = LATAM investor advantage  
✅ **Story:** Compelling narrative = memorable  
✅ **Proof:** Live products = not just talk  

### **What Employers/Investors Want:**

✅ Someone who can execute → YOU CAN (proven)  
✅ Someone who understands AI → YOU DO (built with it)  
✅ Someone with leadership → YOU HAVE IT (7 years exec)  
✅ Someone who ships fast → YOU DO (6 apps, 7 months)  
✅ Someone capital efficient → YOU ARE (<$15K!)  

### **The Path Forward:**

This playbook is comprehensive, but don't get overwhelmed.

**Start with these 3 things TODAY:**
1. Update LinkedIn profile (30 minutes)
2. Pin tweet on Twitter (5 minutes)
3. Apply to 5 jobs on YC Work at a Startup (1 hour)

**Then build momentum:**
- Week 1: Setup + first posts
- Week 2: Content + outreach
- Week 3: Scale what works
- Week 4: Close opportunities

### **You Will Succeed If You:**

✅ Stay consistent (show up daily)  
✅ Provide value (help others)  
✅ Show your work (build in public)  
✅ Follow up (most people don't)  
✅ Don't give up (30 days minimum)  

### **Expected Timeline:**

- **Week 1-2:** Planting seeds, little response (NORMAL!)
- **Week 3:** Things start clicking, conversations happening
- **Week 4:** Multiple opportunities, decision time
- **Month 2:** Closing deals (if needed)

### **Mindset:**

This is a numbers game + a narrative game.

- **Numbers:** The more you reach out, the more responses you get
- **Narrative:** Your story is unique and compelling - tell it everywhere

**You're not just looking for ANY job or ANY investor.**  
**You're looking for the RIGHT fit for your skills and vision.**

### **You've Got This! 🚀**

You left a comfortable executive position.  
You relocated to a new country.  
You learned to code using AI.  
You built 6 production apps.  
You have 2 live products with users.

**If you can do all that, you can definitely land a great job or get funded.**

Now go execute this playbook!
